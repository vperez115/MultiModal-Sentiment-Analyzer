# MultiModal-Sentiment-Analyzer
MultiModal-Sentiment-Analyzer is a Python-based project that combines text and image processing to analyze sentiment. This multi-modal approach allows users to input plain text or upload an image containing text (e.g., screenshots), and the model determines whether the sentiment is positive or negative, along with a confidence score.
